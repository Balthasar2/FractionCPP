{"name":"FractionCPP","tagline":"C++ Fractional Arithmetic Library with Overflow Checking","body":"This is a C++ library that provides a 'Fraction' class that implements full precision arithmetic operations on rational numbers with overflow detection. A rational number in mathematics is a real number that can be represented as a fraction of two integers. We use 'fraction' and 'rational number' synonymously.\r\n\r\nIn almost any useful algorithm involving a sequence of arithmetic operations on fractions, such as summation of fractional series, the magnitude of nominators and denominators can grow very large very quickly. If such operations are not checked for overflow, the end result can be become untrustworthy.\r\n\r\nThis C++ library addresses the above problem by implementing a 'Fraction' class, and checking for the overflow condition in arithmetic operations; If such conditions occur, an exception is thrown. The exception error alarms the calling function.\r\n\r\nThis package defines a class called 'Fraction' and overloads all of the useful arithmetic and comparison operators for this class. This allows the programmers to deal with Fraction objects (rational numbers) in the same manner as integers.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
